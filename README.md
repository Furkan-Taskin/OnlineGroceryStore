# 1.	INTRODUCTION

In this project, we made a desktop application where users can sign up and buy grocery products. Two types of users can enter the application, the first is the customer login and the other is the admin login. If the customer has a registered account, they can log in to the application, if they do not have an account, they can create a new account by clicking the "create an account" text. When logging in to the application, you can see the username and name at the top left, and log out with the "logout" button if desired. Click on the image of the product they want, access the detailed information about the product on the pop-up screen, and add as many products as they want to the shopping cart. He/she can see the products he added to his/her cart in a list box and can remove the product from his/her cart by double-clicking on the product he/she wants to remove from. He/she can see the total amount of his/her basket at the, and he/she can remove one product in his/her basket with the clicking to the product, and his/her can buy the products in his/her basket with the "buy" button. After a successful purchase, there will be a notification. If an admin log in, they can add, remove products want through the "admin panel", update the product they want, and with the "clear" button, they can delete the text boxes containing the information about the product they have created.
